status
======

status is a program in C that can print device information for dwm 
(dwms) or tint2 (tint2s). It works for me and as soon as I need 
something new, I try to implement it.


Requirements
------------
In order to build status you need the Xlib and PulseAudio header files.

Any comments are appreciated.
